# Install on linux

instructions on https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable/ didn't work

`sudo apt-get install fontconfig openjdk-11-jre`

`sudo wget -q -O - https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable/jenkins.io.key | sudo apt-key add -`

`sudo sh -c 'echo deb https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list' `

`sudo apt update`

`sudo apt-get install jenkins`

jenkins is already running as a service at this point. You can check the status of the service with `sudo systemctl status jenkins`

you can access Jenkins service from a browser with `127.0.0.1:8080`

`sudo cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword`

You'll be asked if you want to change the url. You can choose to skip this step if you want. For example, if you're just testing ![](res/2022-05-29-16-05-37.png)
