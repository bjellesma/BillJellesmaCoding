Let's talk about static site generators (SSG). I've been using Gatsby for years which is built on React. However, lately I've become really interested in using Angular. Naturally, I wanted to find an SSG that used Angular. I came to find that Angular had been neglected in the SSG world for a long time. A few months ago, I came across one startup SSG called [Scully](https://scully.io/).

# TL;DR

### Pro

* Working with Angular, my preferred frontend.
  * Faster development

### Cons

* Need to use a production build of Angular each time you change the angular code
  * Adds time for debugging since you'll have one process to build the app and one for the blogging component
* Still not as popular as Gatsby or Jekyll

# QuickStart

Scully works on an existing Angular project so the first thing that you'll want to do is create a new project with `ng new scully-test`. Make sure that you set up routing with the project. If you don't setup routing with the project or if this is an existing project without routing, you can read how to add it with my post on [Angular Concepts](https://billjellesmacoding.netlify.app/blog/20201109_angular_concepts). Within the new project, use `ng add @scullyio/init` to add all of the necessary components for scully. Notice that a new scully folder will be created in your project.

Run `ng generate @scullyio/init:blog` to add blogging functionality to your project. This command will create a blog directory in your `src/app` folder that will house all of the behind the scenes components and modules for your blog. Another blog directory is also created in the root of your project that will house your markdown file.

Next, use the following markdown code to create a test file. This `test.md` will be placed in the `/blog` folder. Notice that the frontmatter includes a published attribute which scully will use to figure out if the post is ready to be public.

```md
---
title: 'Test Blog Post'
author: 'Bill Jellesma'
published: true
---

This is a test
```

We'll want to edit the `scully.scully-test.config.ts` to be able to use this blog folder. The file will be named according to what you named the project so if you name your project `foo`, the file will be `scully.foo.config.ts`.

```ts
import { ScullyConfig } from '@scullyio/scully';
export const config: ScullyConfig = {
  projectRoot: "./src",
  projectName: "scully-test",
  outDir: './dist/static',
  routes: {
    '/blog/:slug': {
      type: 'contentFolder',
      slug: {
        folder: "./blog"
      }
    },
  }
};
```

Create the following npm scripts in your `package.json` to make building and running easier.

```json
"scripts": {
    ...
    "scully": "scully",
    "scully:serve": "npx scully serve --",
    "scully:watch": "npm run scully -- --watch"
  },
```

In order to navigate to your blog post. Modify `app-routing.module.ts` to add the blog route.

```ts
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
import { Routes, RouterModule } from '@angular/router';

const routes: Routes = [
  { path: 'blog', loadChildren: () => import('./blog/blog.module').then(m => m.BlogModule) }
];

@NgModule({
  imports: [RouterModule.forRoot(routes)],
  exports: [RouterModule]
})
export class AppRoutingModule { }
```

Generate a home component that we'll use to discover all of the scully routes with `ng g c home` and use the following code in the generated `home.component.ts`.

```ts
import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';
import { ScullyRoutesService, ScullyRoute } from '@scullyio/ng-lib';
import { Observable } from 'rxjs';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-home',
  templateUrl: './home.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./home.component.css']
})
export class HomeComponent implements OnInit {
  links$: Observable<ScullyRoute[]> = this.scully.available$;

  constructor(private scully: ScullyRoutesSe## Pros and Cons

### Pro

* Working with Angular, my preferred frontend

### Cons

* Need to use a production build of Angular each time you change the angular code
  * Adds time
  * Debugging is more difficult because everything has been made for production already
  }
}
```

Edit the `home.component.html` page to be the following.
  { path: '', redirectTo: '/home', pathMatch: 'full'},

To build and run your project, use `ng build --prod --watch` and `npm run scully:watch`. **Tip** I've found it easiest to use one terminal running `ng build --prod --watch` and another terminal with `npm run scully:watch` so that whenever you make a change to the Angular structure, it is automatically built. If I need to use the angular CLI to make a component/module, I can simply open a third terminal to use those commands.

**NOTE** Make sure to run `ng build --prod --watch` 1st and then `npm run scully:watch`.

Finally, you should be able to navigate to `localhost:1668` in the browser and see the following.

If you click the first blog link, it'll bring you to the test blog post that we created.

We're now off to the races and can begin creating blog posts!
