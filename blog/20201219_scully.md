add to project: `ng add @scullyio/init`

You'll need to build the angular project before serving scully files:
```bash
ng build --prod
npm run scully:serve
```

ng build is only needed when you've modified something in your app. The markdown files, plugin, and config files will not need you to do an ng build again.

However, `npm run scully` will need to be rerun if you change these files. You can use `npm run scully -- --watch` to automatically watch those files. Note that the `--` is important. TODO: why.

**Tip** I've found it easiest to use one terminal running `npm run scully -- --watch` and another terminal with `ng build --prod --watch` for whenever the angular files change. If I need to use the angular CLI, I can simply open a third terminal to use those commands.

## add blog support

`ng generate @scullyio/init:blog` This creates a folder `/blog` where all of your markdown files will live.

Now, rewrite `app.component.html` so that is only has the following html

```html
<router-outlet></router-outlet>
```

## Create an entry point module

Scully needs a module that it'll use to hold all of the routes for all of your different posts. For example, if you wanted to call the module home, you would use `ng generate module home --route=home --module=app-routing`. In the main routing module `app-routing.module.ts`, notice that the following will be added to the routes array.

```js
const routes: Routes = [
  // ...
  {path: 'home', loadChildren: () => import('./home/home.module').then((m) => m.HomeModule)},
];
```

I've also found it helpful to add a redirect on the root of the webapp so the array appears as the following.

```js
const routes: Routes = [
  { path: '', redirectTo: '/home', pathMatch: 'full'},
  { path: 'blog', loadChildren: () => import('./blog/blog.module').then(m => m.BlogModule) }, 
  { path: 'home', loadChildren: () => import('./home/home.module').then(m => m.HomeModule) }
];
```

## Use the component to generate blog data

Using the example of the home module above, replace the component code with the following code.

```js
import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';
import { ScullyRoutesService, ScullyRoute } from '@scullyio/ng-lib';
import { Observable } from 'rxjs';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-home',
  templateUrl: './home.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./home.component.css']
})
export class HomeComponent implements OnInit {
  links$: Observable<ScullyRoute[]> = this.scully.available$;

  constructor(private scully: ScullyRoutesService) {}

  ngOnInit() {
    // debug current pages
    this.links$.subscribe((links) => {
      console.log(links);
    });
  }
}
```

Notice that we've created an observable variable called `links$`. We can now use this variable in our template code to render all of our routes

```html
<p>home works!</p>

<ul>
  <li *ngFor="let page of links$ | async">{{ page.route }}</li>
</ul>
```

## Generating blog data

The markdown files should contain some metadata at the top.

```md
---
title: blog title
description: blog description
published: true
arbitraryValue: single value
arbitraryArray: [first item, second item]
---
```

Scully will use this metadata as part of the `ScullyRoute` interface.

```js
export interface ScullyRoute {
  route: string;
  title?: string;
  slugs?: string[];
  published?: boolean;
  slug?: string;
  sourceFile?: string;
  lang?: string;
  [prop: string]: any;
}
```

For example, if published is set to false, the route will not be generated.

## Creating Posts

Scully recommends that you use their CLI to generate blog posts. This is so that placeholder metadata will generated for you. 

```bash
ng generate @scullyio/init:post --name="New Post"
```

Scully will generate something similar to the following

```md
---
title: 'New Post'
description: 'blog description'
published: false
slugs:
    - ___UNPUBLISHED___kiwi5byl_p0hAAA6WGGfQlatP0eqCBLvGAALaIzRe
---

# New Post
```

Notice that by default, the post is unpublished and has a randomly generated slug. When we set published to true, we'll also need to remove the slug so that the link will now become the expected URL `/blog/new-post`. You will also need to rerun `npm run scully -- --watch` since a new route was generated.

```md
---
title: 'New Post'
description: 'blog description'
published: true
---

# New Post
```

While running `npm run scully -- --watch`, you'll navigate to `http://localhost:1668/blog/new-post` to see your new blog post.

You may want to remove the beginning and ending content and those are found in the html. Simply replace `blog.component.html` with the following.

```html
<scully-content></scully-content>
```

The scully-content tag is used wherever you want the actually blog content to appear.

## Adding a header component

When trying to add components to your application, do not use the component in your home component. Since your home component (or whichever name that you chose) will have its own module, you cannot add a component to your home component. For example, I wanted to add a header component to contain a navigation bar. After creating the component via the angular CLI, I found that I was unable to add the component via HTML to my home component's template. Since my app component's template countained the router outlet, I simply added the header component tag to the app component template.

```html
<app-header></app-header>
<router-outlet></router-outlet>
```

## Pros and Cons

### Pro

* Working with Angular, my preferred frontend

### Cons

* Need to use a production build of Angular each time you change the angular code
  * Adds time
  * Debugging is more difficult because everything has been made for production already
