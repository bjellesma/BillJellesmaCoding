Now that I have my blog built on Angular with the help of [Scully](), my next step was that I wanted to try out using graphql to retreive some of my data. I knew that graphql was an alternative to REST for retreiving data from a server. Fortunately, I found that Netlify offers you to get some server functionality with serverless functions. I then found out that you can run an apollo server using [AWS Lambda](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/deployment/netlify/)
